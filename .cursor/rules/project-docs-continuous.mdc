# Project docs: create and update continuously

Maintain these markdown files under `docs/` and update them in the **same edit session** as the code or config change that affects them. Create a doc if it does not exist yet.

**Doc set:** `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` (or README), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/DATABASE.md`, `docs/FILES_AND_MODULES.md`, `docs/PROMPTS.md`, `docs/RUNNING_AND_TESTING.md`, `docs/GLOSSARY.md` (optional).

**When you change X, update Y:**

- New or changed file under `src/email_assistant/` (nodes, tools, db, entry, schemas, prompts, memory, utils) → **FILES_AND_MODULES.md** (and **ARCHITECTURE.md** if flow/graph changes).
- Env vars or `.env.example` → **CONFIGURATION.md**.
- Schema, migrations, store, checkpointer → **DATABASE.md**.
- Prompt content or location (`prompts.py`, `tools/gmail/prompt_templates.py`) → **PROMPTS.md**.
- Run script, notebook, or test instructions → **RUNNING_AND_TESTING.md**.
- High-level flow, graph shape, state, or node wiring → **ARCHITECTURE.md** (and **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** if the "what it does" summary changes).
- Project purpose, features, or run steps → **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** (or README).
- New important terms → **GLOSSARY.md** (if present).

Reference the phased plan Phase 7 section for what each doc should contain. Do not defer doc updates to a later session.
